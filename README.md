Shopping cart tracker project

The website used to host the project portfolio and documentation was shut down in 2020, so I salvaged everything before the data was lost and put it into a google doc. The doc contains a gantt chart of our deliverables, problem statement, problem background and research, analysis of prior solution attempts, survey of design justificaiton, design concept analysis and selection, a bill of mateirals, and evidence of assembly.
